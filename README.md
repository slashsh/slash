# slang

## a simple scripting language

---

Slang is a simple scripting language written in pure Python without any dependencies (other than Python and a functional computer of course).

### How to use

Download the source code (zip or tar.gz, both are fine) from [here](https://github.com/Butterroach/slang/releases/latest). Extract it. Then open your terminal and go into the new directory and type in `py main.py` (or `python main.py` (or `python3 main.py` (or whatever command idk))) without any extra arguments for the shell, or provide an argument specifying a file that has slang code in it to execute it. If it says command not found or whatever either your PATH is fucked up or you don't have Python (that's up to you to figure out! fun)

Also you should probably use the file extension .sponge (this will have a use in the future) but anything is ok

### How fast is it?

It's written in Python what do you think its speed is

### It doesn't work

This is in alpha shithead (open an issue)

### Great, now how do I code in this

See the wiki whenever I make it (or read the code)

You can also check out the test.sponge file for an example of the syntax for literally everything so far. (no comments explaining what's happening though)

### How can I contribute

Open a PR. If you don't know how to do that uhhhhh

### How do I update?

[Read the first 2 sentences](#how-to-use). Slang will tell you if there's an update if you have internet and GitHub is up and isn't blocked.

### No standalone EXE (or whatever)?

No EXE. Fuck you for even suggesting this. There is absolutely no future for Slang where this will be a thing. You really think there will ever be any. FUCK you. You want an EXE, you build it. Figure that out. Shithead.

### Conclusion

You shouldn't use this
